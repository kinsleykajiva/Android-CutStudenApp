This is a bit more detailed section so this you may not find it very necessary .

The app in the code section you may find that there are modules that have not been used or called in some  sections.
As i was making the app originally the app was meant to an extension to the Official set of CUT apps family ,but when i got back from my attachment to have this app implemented i have met several complications as i had showed the app to the school department.I could no longer make time to meet the many required expectations  for the app as i could not make more time because of my studies.

The app ability to make server download have been removed but the code is there.
The Server Admin section has been eliminated .
